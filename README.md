## About
This project is inspired by tee ([adobe-discord-rpc](https://github.com/teeteeteeteetee/adobe-discord-rpc)), I tried to make my own extension with less features and possibly cleaner code so it is lighter and easier to maintain.



Support for 
- Adobe After Effects
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Premiere Pro



## Preview
![v3.0.0-rpc-demo](https://i.ibb.co/VcvSMxHQ/v3-0-0-rpc-demo.png">)

## How To Install ?

Here's the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/dUXCviKRUGg)

1. **Download and extract the ```com.kureichi.discordrpc.zip``` file from [Releases](https://github.com/Kuredew/adobe-discord-rpc/releases)**

2. **Cut or copy ```com.kureichi.discordrpc``` folder from extracted file to ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions```**

4. **Open Adobe apps you want, then go to Window > extensions, you will see a new extension named ```Discord RPC```.**

5. **Dock the panel to where you want it**

> [!NOTE]  
> RPC will automatically turn on (because the default power value is true), you can turn off the RPC on the panel
