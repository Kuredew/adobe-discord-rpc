## About
This project is inspired by tee ([adobe-discord-rpc](https://github.com/teeteeteeteetee/adobe-discord-rpc)), I tried to make my own extension with less features and possibly cleaner code so it is lighter and easier to maintain.



Support for 
- Adobe After Effects
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Premiere Pro ( Soon )
